**Media Presence Opportunities for Neutrogena:** Based on where and how
competitors across the category are showing up in media, Neutrogena can
go from being a derm leader to a cultural connector by blending
expertise and emotion to reassert Neutrogena’s relevance in a beauty
world defined by discovery, influence, and intent.

- **Reclaim derm authority on screen:** With competitors over-indexing
  on Video, Neutrogena can use Video (Linear TV + Streaming) to reassert
  its "beauty to a science" leadership

- **Close the social science gap:** CeraVe and La Roche-Posay dominate
  social; a heavier short-form push will connect scientific credibility
  with emotional storytelling

- **Bridge intent with innovation**: A social and search synergy can
  convert skincare curiosity into trial, especially for proactive
  millennial audiences researching retinol

**<u>Macro and Micro Trends Reshaping Skincare in the U.S.</u>**

**Trend Insight – Need to Bring Ease to Efficacy:** Consumers aren't
aspiring to "better selves" anymore – they're craving relief from the
pressure to constantly improve. In a culture of wellness burnout, the
brands that will win are those that bring ease to efficacy – restoring
calm, building trust, and feeling like care for both skin and spirit.

- **Category Trend:** Anti-aging remains resilient, but the story is
  being rewritten – from reversing time to respecting it. The new era is
  about sustaining vitality and emotional balance, not chasing youth.

- **Competition Trend:** A wave of clinically coded brands has created
  credibility fatigue. As every product claims science, true
  differentiation now lies in how that science makes people feel – calm,
  cared for, and understood.

- **Consumer Trend:** Americans are no longer seeking transformation;
  they're seeking relief. They want skincare that restores a sense of
  calm as it renews the skin – credible, sensorial, and emotionally
  grounding.

- **Culture Trend:** After years of striving for constant improvement,
  the pendulum has swung toward rest and replenishment. Wellness has
  become less about achievement and more about gentle self-preservation.

**US Wellness Shift: Feeling better is replacing doing better.**
Consumers don't want to do more for their skin – they want products and
experiences that help them feel right in their skin. The opportunity
lies in designing care that's credible, intuitive, and emotionally
restorative.

- **Shift in Focus:** The wellness market is shifting from a focus on
  optimization and efficiency to restoration and emotional well-being.
  Consumers are prioritizing feeling good in their skin over simply
  improving its appearance.

- **Burnout & Emotional Efficiency:** Consumers are weary of constant
  self-optimization and are rethinking what "care" should feel like.
  They are trading long, multi-step routines for intuitive products that
  calm as they correct, and looking for emotional efficiency - results
  that restore balance, not just improve appearance.

- **Trust Through Experience:** Overexposure to expert opinions has
  eroded authority and created decision fatigue. Consumers are seeking
  trusted voices that translate science with empathy and clarity, and
  turning to firsthand experiences - rituals and results that prove
  efficacy without over-explaining it.

- **Micro-Moments of Wellness:** Confidence now comes from knowing what
  works - fewer, better, products that feel instinctively right.
  Consumers are creating micro-moments of wellness through sensory
  design - scent, texture, and ritual as grounding tools. Routines are
  becoming fluid and responsive, adapting to mood and need rather than
  strict regimens.

**Skincare Shift to Self-Care:** Clinical credibility is still key, but
emotional resonance drives repeat use. Skincare is shifting from
anti-aging to age agility – confidence, calm, and credible care at every
stage. The role of skincare is evolving from a purely functional
activity to a self-care practice that promotes emotional well-being and
confidence.

- **Shift From Performance & Perfection to Prevention & Peace:** The
  focus has shifted from achieving perfect skin to maintaining healthy
  skin and promoting a sense of calm.

- **Shift From Routines as Obligation to Rituals as Rewards:** Skincare
  is now viewed as a rewarding ritual rather than a chore.

- **Shift From Fear-Based Anti-Aging to Confidence-Based Longevity**:
  The emphasis is on embracing longevity with confidence rather than
  fearing the aging process.

**A shift from generational marketing to behavioral segmentation**.
Emotional state is more important than generational demographics when
designing skincare products and marketing strategies. The following are
four behavioral segments with distinct mindsets, motivators, and
opportunities:

- **The Overwhelmed Optimizer:** Feels pressure to "do everything
  right." Motivator: Wellness burnout; seeks clarity. Opportunity:
  Simplify and reassure with credible, efficient routines.

- **The Preventive Pragmatist:** Believes in science, not hype.
  Motivator: Wants early prevention without fear-based messaging.
  Opportunity: Medical credibility + achievable results.

- **The Playful Realist:** Treats skincare as self-expression.
  Motivator: Drawn to authenticity and sensory joy. Opportunity: Blend
  clinical function with a witty, lighthearted tone.

- **The Restorative Seeker:** Emotionally fatigued by "fixing" culture.
  Motivator: Seeks calm and control through routine. Opportunity:
  Ritual-based storytelling + soothing sensory design.

**The Evolution of Derm-Influencers:** Medical authority still matters,
but influence has evolved. Consumers do not want Derm-Influencers to
imitate medical authority, but rather translate it. Science needs to be
empathetic, human, and culturally fluent.

- **Clinician Opportunity**: Doctors and derms are open to collaboration
  but warn against oversimplified claims. Credibility depends on
  transparency, not title.

- **Rise of Derm-Influencers:** People increasingly trust hybrid voices
  – professionals who educate with empathy and authenticity.

- **Crowded Clinical Space:** With mass brands already "claiming
  science," differentiation must come from tone, transparency, and
  accessibility.

**<u>CEP Data</u>**

**The priority Category Entry Points (CEPs) for the anti-aging skincare
category are:**

- feel smooth and soft

- stay looking youthful for longer

- feel refreshed and rejuvenated

- repair skin damage

- smooth appearance of fine lines

- support natural renewal process

- firmer and more toned

<!-- -->

- reduce appearance of deep wrinkles

- a confidence boost

**Neutrogena’s key competitors in the anti-aging skincare category
include:**

- CeraVe

- La Roche-Posay

- RoC

- Olay

<!-- -->

- L’Oreal Paris

- Rhode

- The Ordinary

- Tatcha

- Drunk Elephant

Of the 9 anti-aging skincare CEPs, **the CEP Neutrogena is leading in
mental availability and must defend in position** **is “Feel refreshed
and rejuvenated”.**

Of the 9 anti-aging skincare CEPs, **here are the CEPs in which each
competitor brand is leading and that Neutrogena must steal share from:**

- **CeraVe:** feel smooth and soft, repair skin damage, support natural
  renewal process

- **Drunk Elephant:** a confidence boost, firmer and more toned

- **L’Oreal Paris:** smooth appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, stay
  looking youthful for longer

- **La Roche Posay:** reduce appearance of deeper wrinkles

- **Olay:** stay looking youthful for longer, smooth the appearance of
  fine lines

- **Rhode:** firmer and more toned

- **ROC:** reduce appearance of deeper wrinkles, firmer and more toned

- **Tatcha:** a confidence boost

- **The Ordinary:** firmer and more toned

Of the 9 anti-aging skincare CEPs, **the CEP that offers a “white
space”** (an opportunity where no brand has a strong association with a
particular CEP) and should therefore attack in terms of building mental
availability for is **“A Confidence Boost”.** While no brand is
explicitly dominating this CEP, it's a more emotional and general
benefit. Neutrogena could potentially "own" this by connecting it to the
tangible results of its products (e.g., "Get visibly smoother skin and a
boost of confidence with Neutrogena!").

Assuming Neutrogena successfully establishes "A Confidence Boost" as its
white space CEP, **5 CEPs with a potential halo effect** (other CEPs
that could be tapped in tandem to build mental availability) include:

- **Feel Refreshed and Rejuvenated:** (Connect confidence to feeling
  good in your skin)

- **Smooth Appearance of Fine Lines:** (Tie confidence to visible
  improvement)

- **Repair Skin Damage:** (Link confidence to healthy, restored skin)

- **Stay Looking Youthful for Longer:** (Associate confidence with
  proactive skincare)

- **Feel Smooth and Soft:** (Connect confidence to comfortable,
  touchable skin)

**Some overarching insights to consider include:**

- "Confidence boost" appears as a priority CEP across multiple
  generational cohorts and audiences, suggesting a significant
  opportunity for Neutrogena to own this benefit.

- CeraVe consistently appears as a competitor in the "Support renewal
  process" and "Feel smooth & soft" CEPs, indicating a need for
  Neutrogena to differentiate itself in these areas.

- Olay and RoC are frequently identified as competitors in the "Smooth
  appearance of fine lines" and "Reduce deeper wrinkles" CEPs,
  highlighting the need for Neutrogena to differentiate itself in these
  core anti-aging benefits.

**<u>Contextual & Cultural Data</u>**

- Neutrogena Influencer interviews - Notes Summary:

  - US: Kate Speights, Brooke Monk, Avery Wood

    - 1\. Consumer Mindset: Simplification and Trust

      - Less but better: Influencers report that American consumers are
        pulling back from over-complicated routines and searching for
        reliable hero products

      - People are more educated about skin types and ingredients, yet
        they want content that’s “dumbed down just enough” suggesting
        that they do not want a lecture, but trustworthy guidance

      - Sensitive skin narratives dominates: users want efficacy without
        irritation. They trust products labeled non-comedogenic,
        unscented, or derm-tested

    - 2\. Credibility & Content

      - Authenticity \> Ads: All three US influencers reject scripted or
        purely paid posts. They emphasize organic integration: “Don’t be
        an ad, nobody likes watching scripts.”

      - Front facing, story driven video wins. GRWMs,
        “un-get-ready-with-me” and short, emotionally anchored stories
        outperform highly produced content

      - Relatable experts: derms are useful but only when they
        communicate like regular people. Overly clinical tone alienates
        audiences

      - Peer validation: if users see 10 creators saying the same thing,
        credibility spikes

    - 3\. Trends in Category

      - Information overload: consumers oscillate between wanting
        science and craving simplicity

      - Ingredient minimalism: retinol, hyaluronic acid, SPF are
        understood but also feared due to things like purge phase,
        irritation

      - Science-backed but human: brands that show clinical credibility
        and empathy win

    - 4\. Neutrogena

      - Seen as a starter or legacy brand, “reliable but unexciting”

      - Hydro Boost earns consistent praise for texture and results

      - Younger creators feel the content style is dated and lacking
        freshness or storytelling.

  - Germany: Betul Akbaba/Betula, Taras, Baochii, Diana, Karla

    - 1\. Consumer mindset: Science meets real-life application

      - People want proof and process – they like to know why something
        works and how to use it correctly

      - Ingredient literacy is very high among engaged users. “Which
        vitamin C is it? What’s the ratio?”

      - But mass market consumers are still catching up: “average
        grocery buyer still needs more education”

    - 2\. Tone & Credibility

      - Relatable expertise: they respect dermatologists, but prefer
        when science is simplified visually

      - Trust over hype: A product works only if the creator personally
        uses it; one-off paid posts are distrusted

      - Long term relationships with brands are preferred; influencers
        emphasize one-year collaborations, not one offs

      - DM Culture: deep two-way interactions, hours daily answering
        skincare questions suggest that authenticity and accessibility
        are key

    - 3\. Category & Cultural trends

      - Functionality + efficiency: multi-purpose products that save
        time fit the pragmatic lifestyle

      - Science minded experimentation: willing to test new products but
        expect data and dermatologist endorsement

      - Maturity = simplicity: echoing US minimalism, but grounded in
        methodical education rather than rebellion against complexity

      - Events: best when experiential and lifestyle driven, not purely
        informational

    - 4\. Neutrogena Takeaway

      - Known for youth; trusted but somewhat invisible now

      - Hydro Boost and blue body cream are still loved – emotional
        legacy anchors

      - Brand not easily found in local retail

  - Brazil: Julia Ferrari Costa, Katerina, Jahde Borg Santaella Briquet
    Caradec

    - 1\. Consumer mindset: Emotional connection & Real world proof

      - Consumers look for authentic reviews and relatable people, not
        perfection “I trust my dermatologist, it gives me peace of mind”

      - TikTok is the main search engine for discovery “research on
        TikTok what regular people are saying”

      - They seek validation over instruction to confirm that a product
        actually works for someone like them

      - Price does not equal quality. Neutrogena is seen as accessible
        but less premium, which impacts perception

    - 2\. Trend & Credibility

      - Real life \> Ads: viewers tire of idealized beauty and prefer
        storytelling, humor, daily life context

      - Less is more aesthetic: clean girl aesthetic

      - Behind the scenes & process content performs best: showing how
        products are made or used

      - Legacy tension: derm/heritage brands viewed as old and
        impersonal unless modernized through value based storytelling

    - 3\. Neutrogena takeaways

      - Associated with family tradition and early skincare “I started
        using because of my family”

      - Hydro Boost and sunscreen get strong product specific recall

- Quid Social Listening

  - Neutrogena brand perception: Trusted and Formula-Sensitive

    - Strengths:

      - Neutrogena remains broadly trusted and dermatologist-associated

      - Hydro Boost water gel dominates positive sentiment – praised for
        lightweight hydration, non comedogenic feel, and fast absorption
        for all skin types

      - Seen as effective and affordable

    - Weakness:

      - Formula changes (especially deep moisture lotion) have
        frustrated loyal users who perceive new versions as less
        effective

      - Some ongoing critique of inconsistency between product lines

  - SPF Study

    - A 2024 Australian SPF study damaged credibility around
      Neutrogena’s Sheer Zinc Dry Touch SPF 50 Lotion, which tested at
      SPF 24 when it claimed 50

    - Resulting sentiment is negative and cautionary, focusing on trust
      erosion in sunscreen claims

    - Consumers expect science backed transparency

  - Consumer motivations: Reliable & affordable skincare

    - Market wide trend toward affordable efficacy: users seek
      hydration, anti aging, and SPF without premium pricing

    - Hydro boost sits at the intersection of science, hydration, and
      accessibility, and is a recurring gateway product for new users

    - Consumers value dermatologist recommendation and scientific proof
      but don’t want overly clinical messaging

  - Influencer & Collab Sentiments

    - Jennifer Garner remains a strong long term ambassador – her
      authenticity and focus on skin health + melanoma prevention
      reinforce trust

    - Recent partnerships with John Cena, Nicola Coughlin, and Tate
      McRae are diversifying appeal, though conversation impact is
      moderate compared to Hydro Boost buzz

    - Consumers appreciate campaigns tied to purpose over pure
      endorsements

  - Reddit Insights: Product level sentiment

    - Cleansers

      - Ultra gentle hydrating cleanser: effective, non-irritating

      - Acne cleansers too harsh or drying

      - Good for sensitive skin but “anti-acne” line seen as overly
        aggressive

    - Moisturizers

      - Hydro boost praised for texture and hydration

      - Some irritation or clogging

      - Hero product

    - Sunscreens

      - Hydro boost SPF 50 well loved, no white cast

      - Sheer zinc sticky, heavy, poor texture

      - SPF texture key driver of satisfaction

    - Serums/Treatments

      - Skin perfecting serums liked for texture

      - Complaints of irritation, color change

      - Experimental perception – potential but inconsistent

    - Overall

      - Affordable & reliable

      - Hit or miss

      - Portfolio perceived as inconsistent in quality

  - Key emotional drivers

    - Hydration & comfort: positive emotional pull

    - Trust & familiarity: still strong, but vulnerable to performance
      missteps

    - Science & safety: rising as credibility factor, especially for SPF
      and actives

    - Frustration with inconsistency: risk to brand equity if not
      addressed through clearer segmentation and communication

# **APPENDIX**

**CEP Data**

**<u>What are Category Entry Points (CEPs)?</u>**

- **Definition:** CEPs are the thoughts people have when they transition
  into being a category buyer, and therefore a potential brand buyer.
  They are the mental and external cues that trigger category purchases.
  These cues come from both internal feelings/motivations and the
  external environment (places, people). These thoughts act as retrieval
  cues that shape the options that are mentally available to buy at that
  time.

- **Importance:** CEPs are key brand memories that underpin Mental
  Availability. They help a brand be thought of by category buyers
  across different buying contexts, driving sales growth. Research shows
  that brand growth comes primarily from bringing more buyers to the
  brand, through investments in Mental and Physical Availability.

**Why are CEPs Important?**

- **Growth:** CEPs help brands identify high-value growth opportunities
  and build a stronger mental presence, leading to increased sales and
  market share.

- **Objective Understanding:** CEPs leverage a scientific understanding
  of how memory triggers buying behavior, revealing the exact mental and
  external cues that lead to purchases.

- **Consumer-Centric:** CEP analysis focuses on understanding the
  specific retrieval cues (internal thoughts, emotions, motivations, or
  external influences) that buyers use to access brands from memory in
  different buying situations, directly reflecting how human behavior is
  encoded into practices.

- **Competitive Advantage:** CEP analysis provides insights into how
  category buyers rank and prioritize brands in key purchasing moments.

**<u>Can you provide an overview of the steps to conduct a CEP
Analysis?</u>**

**1. Identifying Category Entry Points:**

- **Objective:** Create an exhaustive list of potential category entry
  points.

- **Process:**

  - **Qualitative Market Assessment:** Conduct surveys with real
    category buyers.

  - **Identify Choice Drivers:** Spend time understanding drivers of
    choice through the **W's Framework**.

  - **Summarize CEPs:** Create summaries of all potential category entry
    points.

  - **Validate:** Reference materials to ensure proper CEP structure and
    definitions.

  - **Consider Buying Behaviors:** Consider how people enter the
    category, purchase frequency, and how these relate to the seven W's.

- **Output:** An exhaustive list of potential CEPs.

**The W's Framework:**

The document mentions the "W's Framework" as a tool to systematically
identify and classify CEPs. This framework includes:

- **Why:** The basic motivations or benefits.

- **When:** The time of day, week, or year when the need arises.

- **While:** The activities being done before, during, or after engaging
  with the category.

- **Where:** The location where the category engagement takes place.

- **With/for Whom:** The purchase is for oneself or for others.

- **With What:** Other categories that might accompany the purchase.

- **HoW feeling:** The emotions generated before, during, or after
  engaging with the category.

**2. Ranking CEP Importance:**

- **Objective:** Determine the relative importance of each CEP.

- **Process:**

  - **Initial Hypothesis Ranking:** Use existing category purchase data
    and research to determine preliminary ranking.

  - **Deduplication:** Review the long list of CEPs and ensure that each
    is distinct and stands alone.

  - **Quantitative Survey Design:** Survey category buyers using

**<u>How can CEP Analysis can be valuable for the pitch, in context of
Neutrogena’s business needs and background?</u>**

1.  **Identify Key CEPs for Anti-Aging and Wrinkle Repair:**

    1.  Understand the specific thoughts, feelings, and situations that
        trigger consumers to consider anti-aging products and wrinkle
        repair solutions.

    2.  The W's framework will be critical here:

        1.  **Why:** What are the underlying motivations for wanting to
            reduce wrinkles (e.g., feeling more confident, looking
            younger, addressing specific concerns)?

        2.  **When:** What time of day, week, or year are consumers most
            concerned about wrinkles (e.g., before a special event,
            during winter when skin is drier)?

        3.  **While:** What activities are consumers engaged in when
            they think about wrinkles (e.g., looking in the mirror,
            seeing photos of themselves, scrolling through social
            media)?

        4.  **Where:** Where are consumers when they consider wrinkle
            repair (e.g., at home in the bathroom, at the drugstore,
            online)?

        5.  **With/for Whom:** Are they buying for themselves or for
            someone else?

        6.  **With What:** What other products or categories are they
            considering alongside wrinkle repair (e.g., sunscreen,
            moisturizers, makeup)?

        7.  **HoW feeling:** What emotions are they experiencing (e.g.,
            anxiety, frustration, hope)?

    3.  This will help you identify the most relevant CEPs to target
        with your marketing efforts.

2.  **Assess Neutrogena's Current Mental Availability:**

    1.  Determine how strongly Neutrogena is currently linked to these
        key CEPs in consumers' minds.

    2.  Are consumers thinking of Neutrogena when they think about
        wrinkle repair? If not, why not?

3.  **Understand the Competitive Landscape:**

    1.  Identify which competing brands (CeraVe, LRP, Cetaphil, The
        Ordinary, Paula's Choice, Drunk Elephant, etc.) are most
        strongly linked to the key CEPs.

    2.  Where are there opportunities for Neutrogena to differentiate
        itself and "own" specific CEPs?

4.  **Inform Messaging and Creative:**

    1.  Use the CEP insights to develop messaging and creative that
        resonates with consumers at the moments when they are most
        receptive to anti-aging solutions.

    2.  Focus on the specific motivations, situations, and emotions that
        drive their consideration.

    3.  For example, if a key CEP is "feeling self-conscious about
        wrinkles in photos," the creative could show how Neutrogena
        Rapid Wrinkle Repair helps consumers feel more confident in
        their appearance.

5.  **Optimize Channel Strategy:**

    1.  Determine the best channels to reach consumers at the moments
        when they are most likely to be thinking about wrinkle repair.

    2.  This could include social media (especially TikTok, given the
        rise of beauty on the platform), e-commerce, and in-store
        placements.

6.  **Connect with Gen Z:**

    1.  Given Gen Z's importance as a growth catalyst, it's crucial to
        understand their specific CEPs related to anti-aging (even
        though they may not be the primary target for wrinkle repair).

    2.  Are they concerned about preventative measures? Are they
        influenced by social media trends?

    3.  This will help you develop messaging and strategies that
        resonate with this important demographic.

7.  **Reinforce "Beauty to a Science" Positioning:**

    1.  Ensure that all messaging and creative reinforces Neutrogena's
        "Beauty to a Science" positioning.

    2.  Highlight the scientific evidence behind the Rapid Wrinkle
        Repair ExoRetinol formula and its effectiveness.
